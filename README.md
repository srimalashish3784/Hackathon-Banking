We will be using roc_auc_score for evaluation.

### Data Set Information

The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

There are two datasets: train.csv with all examples (32950) and 21 inputs including the target feature, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014]

test.csv which is the test data that consists of 8238 observations and 20 features without the target feature

Goal:- The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).
